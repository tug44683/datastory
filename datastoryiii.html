		<h4>By Kenneth Cooper</h4>

		<div class="story">

			<p>10 years ago…</p>

			<p>Wide-eyed and probably numb-legged, I felt empowered getting out of my seat after seeing Iron Man with my dad and younger brother. The black and white lights of the end credits filled the theatre. I remember being enamoured with the character Tony Stark. I ran to the exit reenacting all of the action moves I had just witnessed. A ritual that I wait until I get home to do today at the youthful age of 20. </p>

			<p>As I approached the dimly lit tunnel leading to the exit, sounds began to play once more from the stereo of the 0theater. Everyone who had remained in the theater turned around in unison as a new ritual began to take form: the trademark Marvel Post Credit Scene.</p>

			<p>In this particular scene, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, introduces himself to Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and the audience by mocking him and asking him a rhetorical question:</p>

			<blockquote>
				"’I am Iron Man’. You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe, you just don't know it yet."
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				"Who the hell are you?"
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				"Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.."
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				"Ah."
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				"I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative."
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				―Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man
			</blockquote>

			<p>And the rest is history. 10 years later and a lot has changed in the world of film, however, that “world” that Nick Fury so emphatically proposed has evolved into the highest grossing franchise of all time.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/181936"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>Before we dive into the reasons behind Marvel’s unprecedented success at the box office, a trend has to be identified. Over the last 20 years, the big screen has seen a dramatic shift in the type of films that yield the most money in a given year. In 1998 seven amount of films were stand-alone and three were connected to a larger franchise. Oh, how the times have changed.</p>

			<p>In 2008, audiences domestic and worldwide saw the release of Iron Man, the catalyst for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Additionally, films like the Dark Knight and Hancock were staples at the box office. The year 2018, although incomplete, has seen a complete purge of stand-alone films altogether from the top 10. In fact, the only five stand-alone films grace the top 20.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/181961"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>Nick Fury was clearly criticizing Iron Man’’s bravado to identify himself as the man behind the mask, but those words ”you’ve become a part of a bigger universe” could just have easily been motif of the film industry. Franchises are the new craze even though sequels and trilogies are not new phenomena. For as long as stories could be properly manifested, the pen has touched paper again to give the characters life once more. However, there has never been a shared universe on the big screen in which multiple franchises (under the same company of course) have interacted.</p>

			<p>This concepts of subverting reality in literature and film to create something new is known as world building. From George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, to J.R.R. Tolkien, the writer behind lord of the rings, world building has had a profound effect on literature and film. However, none of these contemporaries have built a world as expansive as Marvel on the big screen.</p>

			<p>While superhero franchise films are the clear cash cow at the box office, this renaissance began at a time of decreasing ticket sales. And even though ticket sales have generally been trending downwards, the box office has seen 10 straight years of 10 billion plus dollars earned.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/181983"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>Obviously, causation cannot be determined solely from two variables in such a relatively short timespan, but this winning streak coincides with the year in which Iron Man debuted and The Dark Knight received critical acclaim.</p>

			<p>Superhero movies have doubled down on the world building philosophy that lies at the foundation of franchises. The novelty of a shared universe that does not just focus on one superhero and/or group of superheroes is a new idea in the world of film. In fact, Marvel and DC have both created shared universes in which their heroes interact in the MCU and Detective Comics Expanded Universe (DCEU) respectively.</p>

			<blockquote>
			"There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to...to fight the battles we never could."
			</blockquote>
			
			<blockquote>
			―Nick Fury in The Avengers
			</blockquote>
			

			<p>However, not all superhero universes are created equal. While DC reached its peak in the Batman trilogy, they have failed to reach that height with their new DCEU. In fact, Marvel’s three Avengers movies have out-earned the five movies that make up the relatively new DCEU.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/181985"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>And it is not just the box office where Marvel’s mightiest heroes are beating DC, the critics seem to have a collective favorite as well. Part of what makes Marvel’s 20-movie run so impressive is the fact that none of its movies have received a rotten rating from Rotten Tomatoes. To put that in perspective, the franchise with the most films, James Bond, has 19 “fresh” films and six rotten films. The only other franchise with more than eight films that also maintains a perfect fresh streak is the Harry Potter series with nine fresh films.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/181949"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>


			<p>Not only is the MCU the most lucrative franchise with more than $6.8 billion earned, but they are also the most critically acclaimed franchise as well, able to flex their muscles at the box office and flaunt an unheard of winning streak amongst the critics.</p>

			<p>Marvel has essentially provided a fully immersive experience. Unlike the bleak and dark tone of the DCEU, the MCU creates a world in which the audience could see themselves living in. A world in which justice always prevails and the heroes do not take themselves too seriously. The fun and light-hearted tone is the one common thread that all of their newer properties have. Juxtapose that with the current DCEU and one could see why the audience has latched on to the Avengers instead of the Justice League.</p>

			<p>It is not just tone in which the two universes differ. DC was just completing their critically acclaimed Batman trilogy as Marvel started its ascent to the top. So when DC decided to start from scratch, they have essentially been trying to play catchup. Instead of letting the story hash itself out, DC has sacrificed character development and an intriguing plotline for a rushed product that has prevented the audience from exploring the universe.</p>

			<p>Marvel gives the audience just enough omnipotence to explore the universe but not enough to ruin the surprises for themselves. The audience got a peak of the major villain, Thanos back in 2012, but he did not become a fixture in the primary plotline until 2018. The architects of the MCU have earned enough trust with the audiences over the years to take such risks.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/182010"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>DC does seem to be learning from its mistakes. After striking out in its first four films, DC released Wonder Woman which was not only a beast at the box office but won over critics with an astounding 93% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the DCEU’s only fresh rating to date. With the release on Aquaman around the corner, early opinions from some of the critics would give the DCEu another positive go with the critics. The movie projected to receive a 76% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Not bad.</p>

			<p>Far too often comic book movies rely on an antagonist hellbent on destroying the world. It is as cliche as it is overused. However, in the case of the MCU, the audience actually understood the stakes of “world domination”. Fans spent nearly a decade with these characters. This truth is why the architects of the MCU doubled down on the “idea” in the trailer for Avengers: Infinity War, a callback to Nick Fury’s famous speech from the first Avengers movie.</p>

			<blockquote>
				“There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people. To see if we could become...something more. So when they needed us, we could fight the battles...that they never could”
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			-Each of the Avengers
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				“In time you'll know what it's like to lose...To feel so desperately that you're right, then to fail all the same. Dread it! Run from it! Destiny still arrives.”
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				-Thanos
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				“Evacuate the city. Engage all defences...and get this man a shield.”
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				-Black Panther
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				“Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face.”
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				-Thanos
			</blockquote>

			<p>That is the appeal. That is where the conflict lies. That is where Marvel has repeatedly set itself up for success where the other franchises have not. </p>

			<p>Marvel spent 10 years cultivating a fun universe filled with the characters many have come to love. </p>

			<p>Enter Thanos:</p>

			<p>A villain actually hellbent on destroying the world and “fun” in the process. The unstoppable force that is the MCU met an immovable object and the threat could not have been any more real. </p>

			<p>Spoilers: Not only did Thanos deliver on his promise, but with the cliffhanger ending in Avengers: Infinity Wars, has the audience asking the $6.8 billion dollar question that is the fuel for the MCU:</p>

			<p>What happens next?</p>

			<p>Unprecedented success at the box office and amongst critics. And for our heroes, well, just like Tony Stark says at the beginning of the recently released trailer for Avengers: Endgame,</p>

			<p>“Part of the journey is the end.”</p>
