			<p>PHILADELPHIA.- Huddled masses stood in looping lines outside of The Dell Music Center. Whether it was the anticipation of a certain political figure’s special appearance or the first unexpected temperature cooling of the fall, there was not a goosebump free individual in sight.</p>

			<p>Yearning to get a glimpse of former President Barack Obama on the campaign trail for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, Philadelphia fully embraced the attention it was getting from the Democratic hopefuls.</p>

			<p>Strawberry-colored ticket in hand, I walked through the intense security screenings and entered the venue. I descended to the lowest level, passing by the multiple secret service details, and sat three rows from the stage.</p>

			<p>From Senator Bob Casey to Governor Tom Wolf, I watched as each face graced the stage as the energy exponentially increased in anticipation of the key speaker. These kinds of people just have a certain aura about them, evoking an emotional response that often transcends the political spectrum. You do not get it until you get it. You have to see it to believe it.</p>

			<p>Sleeves-cuffed and light blue shirt half buttoned to the collar, Barack Obama appeared from the shadows behind the stage to a series of inviting chants, cheers, and screams. His appearance and demeanor made him appear a if he was portraying a working man ready to work for everyone. All eyes were on him, the supposed unifying force of the Democratic party: the human embodiment of the oncoming Blue Wave. Everyone in the venue may not have agreed with the positive reaction the President was getting, however, it would not be an overstatement to say that the electrifying energy provoked an encore of goosebump covered necks.</p>

			<p>The audience began to settle as Obama opened his mouth for the first time in front of the crowd. While he started off his speech with his normal charismatic flair, his facial expressions shifted to inflect a more serious tone when he began talking about the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

			<p>“My message, Pennsylvania, is vote. Now, I shouldn’t really have to deliver the message,” Obama said. “This November’s election is more important than any I can remember in my lifetime. Now, politicians will say that all the time. I said it when I was running and I was on the ballot. Obviously, it was the most important election to me (laughs). But this time it really is different. This time the stakes really are higher.”</p>

			<p>Obama covered a multitude of topics, but his comments about this election being the most important one in recent memory stuck out to me. I couldn’t count on both hands how many times that politicians in elections past and present emphasized that their current election was the end all be all.</p>

			<p>The stakes being higher, however, is a much more subjective phrase. The balance of perception versus reality when expounding upon the stakes of an election is key. There are political stakes, social stakes, and economic stakes. “These challenges look at civic trust and make people feel like the game is rigged. Then you have big money coming into politics and it felt like all the politicians aren’t listening to us,” Obama said. “They’re listening to lobbyists and folks who are pulling strings behind the scenes.”</p>

			<h3 class="big-subhead">The History of Campaign Financing</h3>

			<p>The United States has a long and complicated history with money influencing politics. From the spoils system used heavily by Andrew Jackson in the early 1800’s to the passing of the Pendleton Act in 1883, there are periods throughout the history of the US with less restrictions and more restrictions concerning the election process. While the spoils system did not exclusively deal with money, it set a precedence in this country allowing for money to creep behind the curtains of the campaign process.</p>

			<p>In 1890, the National Appropriations Bill, the first federal legislation regarding campaign financing, was enacted. It banned campaigns from receiving donations from navy yard workers. In the decades following that decision, several major acts have been passed, including the Tillman Act and the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p>

			<p>More recently, however, the Supreme Court has made several landmark decisions that have completely altered the political landscape. In 2010, the Supreme Court decided in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that the government could not limit the spending groups and corporations in political campaigns. Then in 2012, the Supreme Court announced another decision that ruled that individual donation limits violate free speech.These two court cases have virtually allowed for an unlimited amount of money to be pumped into any election.</p>

			<h3 class="small-subhead">Behind the Scenes Indeed</h3>

			<p>In order to understand the complex system of campaign financing, there are important terms that must be laid out and defined. The business of influence and lobbying attracts several types of groups heavily involved with donation aspect of politics. Of course individual donations play a major role, but they often pale in comparison to the influence of the following groups.</p>

			<p>Interest groups and lobbyists like the National Rifle Association and the American Association of Retired Professionals are groups or individuals that use a wide array of tactics to persuade politicians. While they donate to candidates, their grassroots actions to alter policies is what they are generally known for.</p>

			<p>Political Action Committees (PACs) are created for the sole purpose of raising money for particular candidates and parties. Often reflecting interests in the business or ideology sector, PACs have limits on the amount money they can contribute.</p>

			<p>Super PACs on the other hand have no limit on the amount of cash they can dish out. They do not contribute directly to candidates, but they can make independent expenditures in federal elections. This can be put towards ads and other non-coordinated actions. Therefore, money donated through super PACs count towards outside spending.</p>

			<p>Outside spending refers to every single independent political expenditure in an election. Super PACs play a major role, but other organizations operate under this umbrella. The most controversial being “dark money” groups which are 501(c) organizations that do not have to disclose the source of their donations. Despite the fact that these organizations have increased spending nationwide from about $5 million in 2004 to close to $140 million in 2018, the IRS has done little to hinder its presence in elections.</p>

			<h3 class="small-subhead">Mo’ Money, Mo’ Problems</h3>

			<p>Candidates for elected office recognize the importance of spending wads of cash to support their bids to represent the american people in office. Constituents donate to their candidate of choice based on a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, ideology, likeability, political affiliation or even gender. However, other sources of funding like corporate contributions, political action committees and dark money have raised the stakes significantly and is likely the difference between success or failure for many politicians. Some have wondered aloud whether campaign financing laws are broken as elected officials seem beholden to the legislative leanings of their corporate contributors rather than crafting legislation that is in the best interest of the constituents they represent.</p>

			<p>Since 2000, the amount money raised on US congressional races alone has grown by approximately 250% to a record $4.1B by the 2016 election. According to data from the Federal Elections Committee compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, 2018 will be the most expensive year for congressional house races in US history. During this current election cycle, house candidates have raised more than $1.5 billion and have spent more than $1.3 billion, both significant increases from the 2016 and 2014 congressional house elections. In recent years, more and more money has been siphoned into elections on the federal, state, and local levels.</p>

			<p>During President Obama’s visit to Philadelphia, he railed on the impact big money was having on our politics and the overall discourse of the nation. He spoke of how many of the republicans were no longer be listening to the will of the people but focused their attention on legislations that benefits their biggest donors. The political discourse in recent years has become more divisive and caustic that is, in part, due to the onslaught of negative ads against each candidate. These carefully crafted ads that run on a continuous loop often influence voters by preying on fear and misinformation that simply distract voters from real concerns. Addressing this problem through more effective campaign financing regulations may be the only means to break the trend.</p>

			<p>The addition of dark money muddles the equation of elections. Because it is nearly impossible to find the source of these contributions, anonymous actors can influence the election with money as when and wherever they please.</p>

			<h3 class="small-subhead">Survey Says...Money Talks</h3>

			<p>Money has always played an influential role in the American political scheme. During the mid-1800’s, republican Senator Mark Hanna was famously quoted:</p>

			<blockquote>There are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I can’t remember what the second one is.</blockquote>

			<p>This quote still resonates today as political parties and other contributors pour money into our election system at a staggering rate but with the same goal in mind.</p>

			<p>Using campaign financial data from the Center for Responsive Politics and election result data from several publicly available resources, one can gain insight into the level of correlation campaign financing (I.e. outside spending and dark money) has as it pertains to election results. If highly correlated, the total amount of money raised is usually an early predictor of the outcome of any particular election.</p>

			<p>Based on the analysis of the data, there is a strong positive correlation between the winner of an election and the amount of money being invested into a particular candidate. In fact, when looking at the 2014 and 2016 congressional races for Pennsylvania, the total amount of money invested into a candidate was the determining factor in all but two races: PA District 2 in 2014 and PA District 8 in 2016.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/149553"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>In that 2016 District 8 race, democratic candidate Steven Santarsiero recorded a slightly higher amount of money raised, yet lost to Brian Fitzpatrick 54% to 46%. The Democrats seized on the opportunity to challenge in the historically republican district since this was Brian’s first run for elected office. However, his name recognition in the district proved too much to overcome. Brian’s brother Michael had previously held the seat.</p>

			<h3 class="small-subhead">New Map, Who’s This?</h3>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/149562"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>In January 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the existing congressional map (pictured right) in a 5-2 split decision. The court ruling stated that the map “clearly, plainly and palpably” violates the state’s Constitution and ordered a new map (pictured left) be redrawn by February 2018 for use in upcoming primary election in May 2018. When the GOP controlled legislature would not abide by the ruling a Republican partisan gerrymandering therefore violating the state’s constitution. As a result, the state’s supreme court drew a new map that could potentially shift the balance of power toward the Democrats in future elections.</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/148123"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>Past elections in both the 2014 and 2016 allowed for Pennsylvania to elect 13 republican house members and five democratic house members. Changes to the map in 2018, however, allowed both Democrats and Republicans send nine members each to the House of Representatives. Just as in 2014 and 2016, large campaign funding and specifically dark money played a huge role in determining the winners and which political party benefits the most from those types of contributions</p>

			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/149534"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

			<p>It is easy to look at this and believe that voting does not matter. Quite the contrary, the business of influencing voters thrives because of the power each individual voter has. While it appears that campaign contribution and associated spending could become an early predictor of election outcomes, other variables could also influence voter preferences. Stricter campaign financing laws, rules on negative political ads along with a more educated, less fickle voter may have a positive effect on American political processes and blunt the overwhelming influence big money donors and contributors have on elected officials.</p> 

			<p>To be clear, campaign funding is vital to the political process. It provides candidates with exposure and can help energize grassroots campaigns across the political spectrum. The American political system and legislative processes will likely become less effective without significant reforms but only through the power of the voting booth, will the political system be rescued.</p>
